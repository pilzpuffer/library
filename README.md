This project was meant to be a practice with Objects and Object constructors, and I believe that it was incredible helpful due to hands-on practice that I've got with those concepts.

Since I've also implemented an option to modify existing books, I also got a lot of practice with FormData, getting and displaying its data, which was a really interesting exercise.
