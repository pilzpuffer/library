## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

All icons in this project come from the <a href="https://pictogrammers.com/">Pictogrammers</a> website, it's a really helpful tool for finding icons.

The 'toggle' switch is based on a solution from the <a href=" https://gomakethings.com/creating-a-toggle-switch-with-just-css/">Kelp UI library</a>

Plan:
add custom styling for the 'select' element
